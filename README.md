# 100DaysOfML-LOG
## Day 0 : July 18 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have completed the setup part for this challenge including choosing project.

**Thoughts** : Excited for the challenge, hoping it will help me code ML in a more effective way.

## Day 1 : July 19 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have started with the Machine Learning Nanodegree Course from Udacity. Studied Regression, Classification, Perceptron and Naive Bayes.

**Thoughts** : Feeling fantastic knowing such new things and excited to take it to a higher level.

## Day 2 : July 20 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have completed Perceptron Algorithm, Error Funtion, Softmax and Gradient Descent.

**Thoughts** : Hopefully I will be able to implement some Machine Learning Algorithms from now on.

## Day 3 : July 20 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have completed Multi Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network and several architectures like VGG, ResNet, Inception and Xception in Deep Learning and some parts of Reinforcement Learning.

**Thoughts** : CNNs much much better than MLPs and also Xceptions reveals greater accuracy!
